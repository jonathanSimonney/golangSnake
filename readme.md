Objective of this repository is to make a kinda slither online which will be able to 
let multiple player play together online.<br>

To use it, the server.go shall be launched as it is the server and the different
 player should connect using the .html and assets files. <br>
 
 You should also include a src file with the different 
 package needed(or update the one you have with these package). Look at the server.go file to include the dependencies

TODO : avoid server crashing when JS refreshing!!!
FINISH SERVER SIDE (AS SOON AS POSSIBLE)
